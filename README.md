# MVVM-From-MVC
A single view project that refractors existing code from Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern to Model-View-ViewModel design pattern (MVVM).

MVVM pattern consists of three layers:
        **Model :** App data that the app operates on.
        **View :**  The user interfaceâ€™s visual elements. In iOS, the view controller is inseparable from the concept of the view.
        **ViewModel :** Updates the model from view inputs and updates views from model outputs.
